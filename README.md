# My NLP Project: Amazon Book Review Analysis

Reviews are a valuable source of information that can greatly benefit marketing teams in their decision-making processes. Studying the sentiment of book reviews can help determine whether a book should be removed from sale or promoted further. This, in turn, can lead to increased sales if the analysis is conducted consistently.

## 1. Select a Dataset
The dataset chosen for this project is the Amazon book review dataset, obtained from Kaggle. The specific dataset used focuses on Amazon book reviews and can be accessed at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarkkaanko/amazon?rvi=1).
Dataset : amazon_books_Data

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis → Jupyter Notebook (projet-nlp - exploratory)
Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset and determine the key areas of focus. Various visualizations were used to enhance the exploration process.

## 3. Build Your Preprocessing Pipeline → Python (preprocessing_pipeline )
Implementing an effective preprocessing pipeline is crucial to ensure that the data is appropriately prepared for subsequent stages of the analysis.

## 4. Train a Baseline Model → Jupyter Notebook (projet-nlp - Baseline)
A baseline model was trained after importing the preprocessing pipeline. This initial model served as a starting point for further experimentation and analysis.

## 5. Improve on the Baseline → Same Jupyter  Notebook (projet-nlp - Baseline)
The baseline model's results were used to identify areas for improvement. Various techniques, such as balancing classes through oversampling or subsampling, applying class weights, and conducting hyperparameter tuning via grid search, were explored to enhance the model's performance.

## 6. Use Tensorflow (or PyTorch, JAX, ...) and Train a Sequence Model → Jupyter Notebook (projet_nlp_deeplearning)
In this phase, deep learning models were employed to achieve better results.
